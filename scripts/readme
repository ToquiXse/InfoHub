# InfoHub Scripts

This folder contains automation scripts used to prepare, configure and maintain devices in the InfoHub environment.
The scripts focus on creating a repeatable and reliable deployment process for low-cost display hardware.

All scripts are provided in an abstracted and environment-neutral form.  
Any deployment-specific values (tokens, network settings, URLs, etc.) have been removed.

---

## Purpose

The scripts in this folder help automate tasks such as:

- initial device setup  
- configuration adjustments  
- scheduled routines  
- display control  
- performance and reliability improvements  
- monitoring integration  
- maintenance workflows  

Each script is designed to be easy to understand, modify and adapt.

---

## Usage

Scripts can be run individually or as part of a larger provisioning process.  
Refer to instructions within each script for details on usage or adaptation.

## Notes

- This folder will expand over time as more components of InfoHub are documented.
- Scripts are intentionally generic to avoid exposing environment-specific information.
- Examples are meant for learning, adaptation and demonstration of working methods.
