# InfoHub

InfoHub is a project for building smart and reliable information displays using low-cost hardware.
It shows the full workflow behind the solution — from selecting equipment and building processes to scripting,
automation and device management. The project reflects a hands-on approach where one person often handles everything
from design to operation, much like a small IT department.

## Goals

- Demonstrate how to design and deploy low-cost, reliable information displays
- Show the full workflow behind the solution
- Provide examples of automation, scripting and device routines
- Share practical methods for working as a solo IT operator

---

## Components

- **Hardware choices** (abstract examples, no brands required)
- **Process design**
- **Automation scripts**
- **Device management routines**
- **Dashboard logic and examples**
- **Case studies**
- **Tools and templates**

---

## Structure (planned)

- `/scripts/` – automation and helper scripts (general, abstract)
- `/hardware/` – neutral explanations and diagrams
- `/processes/` – workflows, routines, checklists
- `/dashboard/` – logic, ideas, examples (no sensitive details)
- `/cases/` – problem → reasoning → solution
- `/docs/` – documentation, diagrams, small articles

---

## Status

The project starts with foundational documentation.  
Code and examples will be added gradually.
