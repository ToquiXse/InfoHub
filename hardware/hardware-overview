# Hardware Overview

InfoHub is designed to run on simple, affordable and reliable hardware. The goal is to create an information display
solution that can be deployed in many locations with minimal cost and maintenance. This section describes the hardware
choices used in the project and why they were selected.

---

## Display

Any standard monitor or TV with an HDMI input can be used.  
Preferred features include:

- Automatic power on/off or timer functionality
- Stable HDMI behaviour during long-term operation
- Ability to stay powered on for extended periods
- Optional HDMI-CEC support

The system does not depend on a specific brand or model.  
The only requirement is a reliable HDMI connection.

## Device: Raspberry Pi 4

The system is powered by a **Raspberry Pi 4**, chosen for several reasons:

- Small, silent and energy-efficient
- Stable HDMI output
- Good browser performance for a lightweight display system
- Well-supported community ecosystem
- Easy to replace or scale to multiple units
- Works well with kiosk and signage operating systems

Both 4 GB and 8 GB versions are suitable, depending on availability.

## Operating System: FullPageOS

The project uses **FullPageOS**, a kiosk-style operating system that automatically loads a fullscreen browser on startup.
It was selected because it:

- Boots directly into a predefined URL
- Requires minimal maintenance
- Supports scheduled reboots
- Works reliably on Raspberry Pi 4
- Keeps the system locked down and focused on the display

This makes it ideal for environments where displays must run continuously without user interaction.

If FullPageOS ever becomes unavailable, the project can switch to any equivalent kiosk OS with similar functionality.

## Installation and Deployment

The preparation of each device is handled through a custom installation file located in the `/scripts/` folder.  
This includes:

- Initial configuration
- Browser behaviour settings
- Automation setup
- Optional device metadata routines

The installation file is kept separate from this hardware documentation to maintain a clear structure.

## Summary

The hardware concept is intentionally simple:

- A screen with HDMI
- A Raspberry Pi 4
- FullPageOS as a kiosk browser system

This combination provides a reliable, low-cost and easily maintainable foundation for InfoHub.
