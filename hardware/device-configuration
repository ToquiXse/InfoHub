# Device Configuration

This document describes how the Raspberry Pi 4 used in InfoHub is configured to run as a stable, low-maintenance
information display. The goal is to ensure that each device boots reliably, loads the correct webpage and can operate
continuously with minimal supervision.

## Base Image: FullPageOS

Each device uses a FullPageOS image, chosen because it:

- boots directly into a fullscreen browser
- automatically loads the configured target URL
- supports scheduled reboot or maintenance
- requires no user interaction after startup
- works reliably on Raspberry Pi 4 hardware

FullPageOS is written to the SD card using any standard imaging tool.

## Initial Configuration

After the image is written, the following steps are applied:

1. Set WiFi or Ethernet configuration (depending on deployment)
2. Define the target URL for the display
3. Enable automatic boot into kiosk mode
4. Disable unnecessary services to improve stability
5. Configure automatic reboot if required
6. Set resolution and display parameters

These settings ensure the device behaves consistently across deployments.

## Automation Script

A custom installation script is used to complete the setup in a repeatable way.  
This script is available in the `/scripts/` folder and handles:

- writing configuration files
- setting browser parameters
- adding scheduled tasks
- applying optional metadata routines

Using a script ensures uniform setup across all devices.

## Power and Display

The Raspberry Pi connects directly to any HDMI-equipped display.  
For best results, the screen should support:

- automatic power on/off
- timer-controlled operation
- stable behaviour under continuous use

---

## Summary

The configuration process is built around stability and repeatability.  
Once set up, each device boots directly into an information display, requires minimal maintenance, and can be replaced
quickly if needed.
